= Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file
and is based on https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/[Keep a Changelog].

This project follows the version scheme MAJOR.MINOR.COMMITS where
MAJOR and MINOR provide some relative indication of the size of the
change, but do not follow semantic versioning. In general, all changes
endeavour to be non-breaking (by moving to new names rather than by
breaking existing names). COMMITS is an ever-increasing counter of
commits since the beginning of this repository.
